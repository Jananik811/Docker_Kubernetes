Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 10.128.0.2:6443 --token lqk3yd.z0mdpgly20q0w8m1 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:1f4c378e5e7c9941fa081b6e16457c46aa3ff9f6a94d391c50b986e69e68cf13


On Worker node:

[root@rhel8 ~]# kubeadm join 10.128.0.2:6443 --token lqk3yd.z0mdpgly20q0w8m1     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:1f4c378e5e7c9941fa081b6e16457c46aa3ff9f6a94d391c50b986e69e68cf13

This node has joined the cluster:
* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and a response was received.
* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the control-plane to see this node join the cluster.
